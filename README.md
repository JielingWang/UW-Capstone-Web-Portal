Important Files:

Current reimburse form file is:
```
\vuexy-html-admin\html\ltr\users\user-reimbursement-3.html
```
The only `.js` file to handle reimburse form is:
```
\vuexy-html-admin\app-assets\js\scripts\myScripts\users\reimbursement-new.js
```
Also I tried my best to write notes before each function, hope they're helpful
