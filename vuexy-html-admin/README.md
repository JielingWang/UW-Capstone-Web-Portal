## Administrative and Financial Web Portal for UW College of Enginnering

This is a web application built for University of Washington College of Engineering to manage their daily transaction duties. We're still in the testing phase, if you wanna have a try, here is the testing server URL: http://v2227.host.s.uw.edu/

And we provide several testing IDs so that you can go around within this system:
Submitter:      1969740
Approver:       1969766
Fiscal Staff:   1969420


For front-end, we use (Vuexy HTML Admin Template)[https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-html-bootstrap-admin-template/documentation] which is built based on Bootstrap4 as a frame.

For back-end, we use Node.js and Express framework to build API, and now the back-end work is deployed on Azure.
